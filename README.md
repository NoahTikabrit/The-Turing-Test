# The-Turing-Test

Reading about Alan Turing's thought experiment called the Turing Test, the philosophy behind it prompted me to recreate it with Python.
The test would consist of a human tester communicating via text to a computer and another human simultaneously, 
with the knowledge that only one of them is a computer— it is the tester’s job to decide, based purely on the written 
conversations with the two, which one is the computer and which one is human. 

Turing’s questions is this: could a computer program write and read text at a level so advanced as to be indistinguishable 
from a human writer? 
While my program is not sophisticated enough to pass the test reliably, it does pose some questions about language outside 
of the human mind; namely, what does language look like when not coming out of the mouth of a human? Furthermore, a bigger 
question would be: what would it look like for a computer program to have language?
